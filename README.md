## APTOS Blindness Detection Using Resnet50
APTOS Blindness Detection is the project I have done during my Artificial Intelligence internship at CodeClause.

🔍 **Objective:** Detect and classify diabetic retinopathy levels using deep learning.

🛠 **Technologies Used:**
- Python
- Keras
- TensorFlow
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- ResNet50 architecture

📝 **Description:**
Implemented a deep learning model using the ResNet50 architecture to classify diabetic retinopathy levels based on eye images. Trained the model on the APTOS Blindness Detection dataset, achieving robust performance.
